Do you know how to find shortest path in a Gragh?
Do you remember #BFS and #DFS travers algorithms?
By BFS traverse between two nodes we can find shortest path between thoes nodes.
In this GraphTravers Project you can declare the graph nodes and edges in program.cs file,
Then  calling GetShortestPath function and defining source,destination nodes as parameters.
After running,project will print the shortest path between source and destination in console.
